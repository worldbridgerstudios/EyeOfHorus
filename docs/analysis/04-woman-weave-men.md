# Woman = Weave-Men: The Etymology of Creation

## Discovery

The word "woman" is phonemically transparent:

```
woman = w-o/a/e/i-v-e-m-e-n = WEAVE-MEN
```

She is not "a weaver" — she **weaves men**. The function defines her.

## The Phonemic Web

| Word | Phonemic | Function Encoded |
|------|----------|------------------|
| **woman** | weave-men | She who weaves men |
| **man** | m-a-n | GENERATE-SOURCE-WEAVE — the product, not producer |
| **wife** | wive | "To weave" — verbified woman, function active |
| **womb** | w-m-b | PROTECT-GENERATE-REFINE — the weaving chamber |
| **coven** | c-o-v-e-n | "Co-weave" — collective weaving |

## The Core Insight

```
man   = what is woven
woman = she who weaves men
wife  = the weave-function active ("to wive" = to engage weaving)
womb  = where weaving occurs
coven = women weaving together
```

**Man is woven by the coven.**

## "Wive" as Verb

Archaic usage: "to wive" = to marry, to take a wife

Phonemic truth: **to engage the weave function**

Marriage = entering the weave. The man becomes material for the woman's creative process.

## Connection to Neith

Neith (Egyptian): The goddess whose name IS the weaving phoneme (n = WEAVE)

```
Neith = n-t = WEAVE-MEASURE
      = weaving given proportion
      = the cosmic weave principle
```

Hierarchy:
1. **Neith** — the principle itself (cosmic weave)
2. **Woman** — the embodiment (weave-men = she who weaves men)
3. **Wife** — the function active (to-wive)
4. **Womb** — the location (weave-chamber)
5. **Coven** — collective practice (co-weave)

## Widow: Modern Corruption

"Widow" is a later construction, not original to the phonemic system. The authentic forms concern the **living weave**, not its severance.

The original system focuses on:
- Creation (weaving)
- Not destruction (cutting)

## Primal Sequence Connection

From the baby's phonemic development sequence:

```
a-h-w-m-n-b-p...
"Ah, woman be peg..."
```

The infant's first implicit knowledge:
> The weaver is the anchor.

Before language, the body knows: **woman is the fixed point around which reality weaves.**

## Implications

1. **Etymology encodes cosmology** — "woman" means what she does

2. **Men are products, not producers** — they are woven, she weaves

3. **Marriage is craft** — "to wive" = to engage creative process

4. **Collective power** — coven = co-weaving, multiplied function

5. **The womb is a loom** — PROTECT-GENERATE-REFINE describes textile production AND gestation
