|---|----------|---------|
| 12 | [Layered Decode](12-layered-decode.md) | Five simultaneous readings: core + f1/f2 + m1/m2. ASCEND vs PENETRATE polarity. |

---

### Performance: Bitwise Engine

| # | Document | Summary |
|---|----------|---------|

## Key Formulas

```
T(16) = 136                    # Triangular number, unique wheel relations
136 × 3 = 408                  # × spine axes = total grammar
16 × 5 = 80                    # Wheel phonemes × hourglass positions
5 layers × 2 directions = 10   # Total simultaneous readings
1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 9          # Fibonacci breath (genesis block)
1 : 1 : 2                      # Script ratio (hieroglyph:hieratic:Coptic)
```

## The Two Systems

| System | Phonemes | Function | Temporal Layer |
|--------|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Wheel** | 16 (n-w-s-sh-A-t-H-r-m-a-y-b-p-i-kh-dj) | Rotating, transmissible | Post-merger (~600 BCE) |
| **Spine** | x, d, k (primary); q, tj, g, f, h (secondary) | Fixed frame, scales | Pre-merger (~2000 BCE) |

**Critical distinction:** Plain **d** and **k** are spine phonemes. The wheel has **dj** (palatalized) not plain d.

## The Five Layers

| Layer | Position Pattern | Mode | Pole |
|-------|------------------|------|------|
| core | all eq | — | equilibrium |
| f1 | (pole)(eq)(pole)... | feminine | minima |
| f2 | (pole)(eq)(pole)... | feminine | maxima |
| m1 | (pole)(eq)(pole)... | masculine | minima |
| m2 | (pole)(eq)(pole)... | masculine | maxima |

**Direction determines order:**
- **ASCEND** (L→R): core → f1 → f2 → m1 → m2 (feminine leads up)
- **PENETRATE** (R→L): core → m1 → m2 → f1 → f2 (masculine leads down)
